# Advent of Code 2021
This repo contains my code for AoC 2021

My goal is to do this in Haskell most of the days, 
    but if a lack of time or skill leads me astray from the path of purity I may also fall back to Julia or 
    (if all else fails) Python.

This page might get updated to include run instructions at some point
